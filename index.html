        <p>Bamazon is a Node CLI application which uses a MySQL database to store product and department data. In the
            main menu, there are three options.
        </p>

        <h3>Buy Products</h3>

        <p>Customers can choose this menu to place an purchase order. It will first display all of the items available
            for
            sale.</p>

        <p>The customer is then prompted for the product ID and quantity he or she would like to buy.</p>

        <p>After the cusomter has placed the order, the application will check if there's enough stock to meet the
            customer's request and updates the stock quantity in the database. The total purchase purchase price is
            calculated and also tracked in the database for each product.</p>

        <p>If there's not enough stock, the application displays a message `Insufficient quantity!` and then prevents
            the
            order from going through.</p>

            <li>Add to Inventory</li>
